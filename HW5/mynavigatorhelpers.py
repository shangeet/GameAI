### Returns true if the agent can get from p1 to p2 directly without running into an obstacle.
### p1: the current location of the agent
### p2: the destination of the agent
### worldLines: all the lines in the world
### agent: the Agent object

	return False

### This function optimizes the given path and returns a new path
### source: the current position of the agent
### dest: the desired destination of the agent
### path: the path previously computed by the A* algorithm
### world: pointer to the world

	### YOUR CODE GOES BELOW HERE ###
	return path


### This function changes the move target of the agent if there is an opportunity to walk a shorter path.
### This function should call nav.agent.moveToTarget() if an opportunity exists and may also need to modify nav.path.
### nav: the navigator object
### This function returns True if the moveTarget and/or path is modified and False otherwise
